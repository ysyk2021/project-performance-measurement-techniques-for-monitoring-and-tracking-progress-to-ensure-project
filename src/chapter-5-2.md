# Calculating EVM Metrics

Earned Value Management (EVM) is a widely-used technique for monitoring and tracking project performance. It involves using metrics to measure project progress against planned targets, enabling project managers to identify potential issues and take corrective actions proactively.

In this chapter, we will explore how to calculate EVM metrics effectively.

Understanding EVM Metrics
-------------------------

EVM metrics are used to measure project performance against planned targets. The three primary EVM metrics are:

1. Planned Value (PV): The budgeted cost of work scheduled to be completed up to the reporting date.

2. Earned Value (EV): The budgeted cost of work that has actually been completed up to the reporting date.

3. Actual Cost (AC): The actual cost incurred to complete the work up to the reporting date.

By calculating these metrics, project managers can evaluate project performance and identify potential issues proactively.

Calculating EVM Metrics
-----------------------

To calculate EVM metrics, follow these steps:

1. Determine the Planned Value (PV): Multiply the planned percentage of the task by the total budgeted cost for the task. For example, if a task has a total budgeted cost of $1,000 and it is 50% complete, the PV would be $500.

2. Determine the Earned Value (EV): Multiply the actual percentage of the task completed by the total budgeted cost for the task. For example, if a task has a total budgeted cost of $1,000 and it is 75% complete, the EV would be $750.

3. Determine the Actual Cost (AC): Add up all the actual costs incurred to date for the task.

4. Calculate the Schedule Variance (SV): Subtract the Planned Value (PV) from the Earned Value (EV). A positive number represents favorable variance, while a negative number represents unfavorable variance.

5. Calculate the Cost Variance (CV): Subtract the Actual Cost (AC) from the Earned Value (EV). A positive number represents favorable variance, while a negative number represents unfavorable variance.

6. Calculate the Schedule Performance Index (SPI): Divide the Earned Value (EV) by the Planned Value (PV). An SPI equal to or greater than 1 indicates that the project is ahead of schedule.

7. Calculate the Cost Performance Index (CPI): Divide the Earned Value (EV) by the Actual Cost (AC). A CPI equal to or greater than 1 indicates that the project is under budget.

By calculating EVM metrics effectively, project managers can monitor and track project progress and take corrective actions proactively.

Conclusion
----------

Earned Value Management (EVM) is a valuable technique for monitoring and tracking project performance. By understanding EVM metrics, calculating them effectively, and interpreting the results, project managers can evaluate project performance and identify potential issues proactively. By embracing EVM as a continuous process, project teams can achieve their desired objectives and deliver value to stakeholders.
