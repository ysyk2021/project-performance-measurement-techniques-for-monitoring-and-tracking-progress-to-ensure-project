# Calculating EVM Metrics

## Introduction

In this chapter, we will delve into the concept of Earned Value Management (EVM) and its significance in project performance measurement. EVM is a powerful technique that helps project managers monitor and track progress effectively, enabling them to ensure project success. This chapter will provide a comprehensive understanding of EVM metrics and how they are calculated.

## Key EVM Metrics

### Planned Value (PV)

Planned Value, also known as Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled (BCWS), represents the authorized budget assigned to scheduled work during a specific time period. PV is determined based on the project's approved budget and schedule.

### Actual Cost (AC)

Actual Cost, also referred to as Actual Cost of Work Performed (ACWP), represents the total cost incurred for completing the work within a given timeframe.

### Earned Value (EV)

Earned Value, sometimes called Budgeted Cost of Work Performed (BCWP), indicates the value of work completed up to a particular point in time. EV is derived from the project's performance measurement baseline.

### Schedule Variance (SV)

Schedule Variance measures the variance between the Earned Value (EV) and the Planned Value (PV). It determines whether the project is ahead or behind schedule. The formula to calculate SV is as follows:

`SV = EV - PV`

A positive value denotes that the project is ahead of schedule, while a negative value indicates a delay.

### Cost Variance (CV)

Cost Variance assesses the variance between Earned Value (EV) and Actual Cost (AC). It provides insights into whether the project is under or over budget. The formula to calculate CV is as follows:

`CV = EV - AC`

A positive value signifies that the project is under budget, while a negative value implies an overrun.

### Schedule Performance Index (SPI)

Schedule Performance Index indicates the efficiency of schedule performance on the project. SPI is calculated by dividing Earned Value (EV) by Planned Value (PV). The formula for SPI is as follows:

`SPI = EV / PV`

An SPI value greater than 1 indicates that the project is ahead of schedule, whereas a value less than 1 signals a delay.

### Cost Performance Index (CPI)

Cost Performance Index assesses the efficiency of cost performance on the project. CPI is calculated by dividing Earned Value (EV) by Actual Cost (AC). The formula for CPI is as follows:

`CPI = EV / AC`

A CPI value greater than 1 denotes that the project is under budget, while a value less than 1 implies a cost overrun.

## Conclusion

Calculating EVM metrics is crucial in monitoring project progress and ensuring its success. By understanding and analyzing planned value, earned value, actual cost, schedule variance, cost variance, schedule performance index, and cost performance index, project managers can make informed decisions and take timely actions to steer the project towards its objectives. EVM metrics provide valuable insights into the project's health, enabling efficient management and control throughout the project lifecycle.
