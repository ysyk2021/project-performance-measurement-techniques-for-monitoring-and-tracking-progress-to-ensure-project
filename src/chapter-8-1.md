# Identifying Performance Issues and Risks

Corrective action is an essential aspect of project performance measurement. It involves identifying and addressing issues and risks that may arise during a project, to ensure that the project stays on track towards achieving its objectives.

In this chapter, we will explore how to identify performance issues and risks proactively.

Identifying Performance Issues
------------------------------

Performance issues can arise in any project. They can include:

1. Delays in completing tasks or milestones.

2. Overruns in budget or resources.

3. Quality issues with deliverables.

4. Communication breakdowns between team members or stakeholders.

By identifying performance issues proactively, project managers can take corrective actions promptly and address them before they escalate into more significant problems.

Identifying Risks

Risk management is another critical aspect of project performance measurement. By identifying potential risks proactively, project managers can develop mitigation strategies and minimize their impact on project performance.

Risks can include:

1. Technical risks, such as software compatibility issues.

2. Resource risks, such as team member availability or resource constraints.

3. Schedule risks, such as delays in completing tasks or milestones.

4. Financial risks, such as budget overruns or funding uncertainties.

By identifying risks proactively, project managers can take corrective actions proactively and minimize their impact on project performance.

Techniques for Identifying Performance Issues and Risks
-------------------------------------------------------

There are several techniques that project managers can use to identify performance issues and risks proactively. These include:

1. Brainstorming: Facilitating discussions with project team members to identify potential issues and risks.

2. Root Cause Analysis: Analyzing the underlying causes of issues and risks to identify potential corrective actions proactively.

3. SWOT Analysis: Evaluating the project's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats to identify potential risks and develop mitigation strategies.

4. Risk Assessment: Evaluating the likelihood and impact of potential risks to determine their priority and develop mitigation strategies.

By using these techniques proactively, project managers can identify potential performance issues and risks and take corrective actions before they escalate into more significant problems.
