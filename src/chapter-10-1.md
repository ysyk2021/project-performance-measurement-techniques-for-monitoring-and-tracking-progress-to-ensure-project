Conclusion: Summary of Key Points
=================================

In this book, we explored various techniques for monitoring and tracking project progress to ensure project success. We discussed the importance of performance measurement and how it helps project managers make data-driven decisions to improve project outcomes. The following are some key points from each chapter:

Chapter 1: Introduction to Project Performance Measurement
----------------------------------------------------------

* Performance measurement is critical for evaluating project performance effectively.
* Performance measurement enables project managers to identify issues early and take corrective actions proactively.
* By using performance measurement, organizations can build alignment and commitment towards achieving project objectives.

Chapter 2: Key Performance Indicators: Identifying Relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* KPIs are essential metrics that help project managers measure and track project performance effectively.
* Selecting relevant KPIs is crucial for measuring and tracking project performance effectively.
